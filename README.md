### Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizes trends to help understand business performance, customer preferences, and sales patterns.

### Key Features

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard calculates the following KPIs:
1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

The dashboard includes the following visualizations to provide insights into pizza sales data:
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: A bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers**: A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders.
7. **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers**: A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders.
