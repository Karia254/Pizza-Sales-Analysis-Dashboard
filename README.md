# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizes trends to help understand business performance, customer preferences, and sales patterns.

## Key Features
- **KPIs**: Calculation of key metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts to analyze daily and monthly trends, sales distribution by category and size, and performance of best and worst-selling pizzas.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard calculates the following KPIs:
1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## Charts and Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations to provide insights into pizza sales data:
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: A bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers**: A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders.
7. **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers**: A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders.
